# OxygenShop

OxygenShop is an academic project designed as an online store, built with clean and structured code. The goal is to apply best practices in web development, ensuring semantic correctness and maintainability. This project is currently focused on the foundation of the store, which will be expanded with additional functionalities in the future.

The HTML structure follows the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology, ensuring a clear and scalable architecture. Each component is designed with readability and reusability in mind, making it easier to maintain and extend. Semantic HTML is used to enhance accessibility and SEO performance.

For styling, the project utilizes SASS, allowing for modular and maintainable stylesheets. The use of variables, mixins, and nested selectors ensures an efficient and organized approach to styling. The codebase follows a structured hierarchy, making it easy to update and scale as new features are added.

In the future, JavaScript will be integrated to enhance interactivity and provide dynamic functionalities.
